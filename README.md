# Raspberry Pi Environmental Monitoring and Control System

## Project Overview
This project implements an embedded environmental monitoring and control system using a Raspberry Pi and the Raphael Kit. It integrates multiple sensors to measure temperature, humidity, and light intensity, displays real-time data, and controls actuators based on sensor thresholds. Additionally, the system logs data for later analysis and visualization.

## Features and Implementation

### Sensor Integration
- **Temperature and Humidity**: Using the DHT11 or DHT22 sensor connected to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins, the system reads environmental temperature and humidity data.
- **Light Intensity**: A photoresistor (LDR) is connected and read via an ADC or GPIO interface to measure ambient light levels.

### Data Display
- Sensor readings are displayed in real-time on an LCD or OLED screen connected through the Raphael Kit display module, providing instant visual feedback.

### Actuator Control
- Based on predefined threshold values for temperature and light, the system controls an actuator such as a fan or LED.
- The control logic automatically activates or deactivates the actuator to maintain desired environmental conditions.

### Data Logging and Visualization
- Sensor data with timestamps are recorded in a CSV log file.
- A Python script enables basic visualization of the logged data, facilitating trend analysis over time.

## Setup and Usage

1. **Hardware Wiring**: Connect sensors and actuators to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins as per schematic.
2. **Software Installation**: Install required Python packages using pip.
3. **Running the System**:
   - Execute the main Python script to start reading sensors, displaying data, and controlling actuators.
   - Data logging runs continuously, storing readings to a CSV file.
4. **Data Visualization**: Run the visualization script to generate plots from the logged data.

## Project Structure
- `sensor_readings.py` â€” Reads and processes sensor data.
- `display.py` â€” Handles real-time data display on the screen.
- `actuator_control.py` â€” Contains logic to control actuators based on sensor thresholds.
- `data_logger.py` â€” Logs sensor readings to file.
- `visualize.py` â€” Generates plots from logged data.

## Example Output
- Real-time temperature, humidity, and light levels displayed on the LCD/OLED.
- Actuator (fan or LED) turning on/off automatically when thresholds are met.
- CSV files containing timestamped sensor logs.
- Graphical plots showing environmental trends over time.
